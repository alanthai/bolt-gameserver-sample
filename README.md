Sample backend code snippets to demonstrate how to integrate Bolt's SDK into your game server. 

**Prerequisites:** Make sure you have fully onboarded onto Bolt Charge by [following this guide.](https://help.bolt.com/products/bolt-charge/charge-setup/) It should take approximately 5 minutes.

**Language Support:** Looking for a different language or a particular server SDK? You can easily clone, copy, or paste URL this lightweight repo into your favorite copilot tool and it should do a good job replicating the interfaces for you.

## Key Concepts
Bolt offers an easy to use API to manage your digital products and subscriptions.

- **Products** are what you're selling

- **Plans** are how you're selling it
- **Subscriptions** are active instances of recurring plans

### Products
Products are the base offerings in your game's monetization system. They represent the actual items or services you're selling, such as:
- Virtual currency (coins, gems)
- In-game items (weapons, skins)
- Game expansions
- Premium features

### Plans
Plans define how a product is delivered to the user. They specify:
- The delivery method (one-time purchase, recurring)
- The price point
- Any associated benefits or features
- Duration (for time-based offerings)

### Subscriptions
Subscriptions are active instances of recurring plans. They represent:
- An ongoing relationship between a user and a plan
- The current status of a user's access to a product
- Billing cycles and renewal dates
- Usage tracking and limits
